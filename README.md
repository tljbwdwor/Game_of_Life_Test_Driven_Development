"# Game_of_Life_Test_Driven_Development" 

This project has been developed using Test Driven Development. The game logic and fundamentals 
were build by first creating JUnit tests that initially fail, and then methods were written to
ensure the tests passed. This way, the structure was guided from the bottom up. 

Once the logic was completed, a simple console interface was created which takes user input by way 
of the Java Scanner class. Following that, a JavaFX implementation was created to provide
a more interesting graphical interface. In both of these cases special care was made
to attempt to write the code as cleanly as possible.

The app can be run in the console via the main method (found in ConsoleLaunchpad),
or alternatively in a simple visual interface (via JavaFxLaunchpad).

Problem Description:

This Kata is about calculating the next generation of Conwayâ€™s game of life,
given any starting position. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway
%27s_Game_of_Life for background.
You start with a two dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either alive or
dead. In this version of the problem, the grid is finite, and no life can exist off the
edges. When calculating the next generation of the grid, follow these rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by
   underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
   overcrowding.
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
   generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
   You should write a program that can accept an arbitrary grid of cells, and will
   output a similar grid showing the next generation.
   Try to work with immutable objects and pure functions as much as possible.
